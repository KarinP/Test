#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/bash
while true                            # Forever...
do
    echo "My Process ID (PID) is $$"  # Show the current process id
    echo "And now we are at" `date`   # Show the time and date
    echo "Press [CTRL+C] to stop"     # Show some help
    echo "Press [CTRL+Z] to pause"    # Show more help
    echo "---------------------------------------------------------"
    sleep 1                           # Sleep 1 second
done
#+end_src


** DONE Wrapping up loose ends

*** DONE Use the output of script: scriptreplay, less -R, cat

*** DONE Command line expansion and ls /usr/*n


** DONE Searching things

*** Recap: *which* *whereis*
*** Command: *find*
*** *find* does not use GNU-style options (no "--")
*** *find* predicates
*** Recursion
*** Limiting recursion
*** Doing things with the findings (-exec, *xargs*)
*** Filtering / searching lines: *grep*
*** Optional: regular expressions
*** Optional: better non-standard tools: *grin* and *ag*



** Environment variables

*** Passing information to processes
*** Listing environment variables: *set* or *env*
*** Optional: All environment variables are strings
*** Variable lists (e.g. PATH) are separated by colon (:)
*** Set variable value: VARIABLE_NAME=value
*** Get variable value: $VARIABLE_NAME
*** Variable scope (*export*)
*** $EDITOR
*** $PATH
*** $PWD
*** $LOGNAME
*** $HOME
*** $PYTHONPATH
*** $GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
*** ...


** Job control

*** DONE Processes
*** DONE Process status: *ps*
*** DONE Command: *pgrep*
*** DONE Command: *top*, *htop*, *glances*, *iotop*...
*** DONE The process id (PID)
*** DONE The process tree
*** DONE Parent process, child processes
*** Why *cd* must be a builtin
*** Command *pstree*
*** Kill a process (*kill*, *pkill*)
*** Pausing a process (C-z, Control-z, ^Z)
*** Sending a process to the background (*bg*, "&" command line modifier)
*** Background process id (%BID)
*** Redirecting error (2>, 2>>, &>)
*** Sending a process to the foreground (*fg*)
*** Jobs (*jobs*)
*** Dettaching a process (*nohup*, *disown*)
*** Real-time streaming of a file: *tail -f*
*** Experiment: highly concurrent file rewrite


** Bash history tweaking

*** The truth about the bash history mechanism
*** ~/.bash_history
*** Optional: sourcing
*** When is the history read and written?
*** Tweaking bash: ~/.bashrc
*** Discussion: [[http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1288/preserve-bash-history-in-multiple-terminal-windows][Tweaking the history mechanism behavior]]


** Pending questions

*** How to indicate tab as delimiter for cut?

man cut ==> /tab ==> it is the default!

also: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/how-use-cut-d-%27delimiter%27-is-delimiter-is-a-tab-720186/

*** When to use pipes, when backquotes, when xargs, when exec?

Starting from the fact that some do different things (pipes write to stdin, the rest "generate command lines").

A good example could come from find + grep
