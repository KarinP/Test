** Up to now recap

** Understanding better the command line

*** What is my command? (*which*)
*** What really is my command (*type*)
*** Optional: *hash*
*** What's going on with Dorothea's *cd*?
*** Command line expansion
*** globbing
*** Glob patterns ("*", "?")
*** Controlling expansion: quoting
*** Single and double quotes behave differently
*** Grave quotes ("`")

*** Command: *ps*
*** Command: *top*
*** The process id (PID)
*** The process tree
*** Parent process, child processes

*** Sending a process to the background (*bg*, "&" command line modifier)
*** Sending a process to the foreground (*fg*)
*** Dettaching a process (*nohup*, *disown*)
*** Real-time streaming of a file: *tail -f*

** Putting all together: bash history tweaking

*** The truth about the bash history mechanism
*** ~/.bash_history
*** When is the history read and written?
