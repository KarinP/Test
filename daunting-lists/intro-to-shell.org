** Up to now recap

** Understanding better the command line

*** What is my command? (*which*)
*** What really is my command (*type*)
*** Optional: *hash*
*** What's going on with Dorothea's *cd*?
*** Command line expansion
*** globbing
*** Glob patterns ("*", "?")
*** Controlling expansion: quoting
*** Single and double quotes behave differently
*** Grave quotes ("`")

** Job control

*** Jobs?
*** Process
*** Command: *ps*
*** Command: *top*
*** The process id (PID)
*** The process tree
*** Parent process, child processes
*** Command *pstree*
*** Kill a process (*kill*)
*** Pausing a process (C-z)
*** Sending a process to the background (*bg*, "&" command line modifier)
*** Sending a process to the foreground (*fg*)
*** Dettaching a process (*nohup*, *disown*)
*** Real-time streaming of a file: *tail -f*

** Putting all together: bash history tweaking

*** The truth about the bash history mechanism
*** ~/.bash_history
*** When is the history read and written?
*** Tweaking bash: ~/.bashrc
*** Tweaking the history mechanism behavior
*** Writing scripts
*** Getting crazy with processes
*** Big troubles: concurrency

** Getting better at searching

*** Recap: *which* *whereis* *type*
*** Command: *find*
*** *find* does not use GNU-style options (no "--")
*** *find* predicates
*** Mind blowing recursion
*** Simple minded recursion
*** Doing things with the findings (-exec, *xargs*)
*** Filtering / searching lines: *grep*
*** Optional: regular expressions
*** Optional: better non-standard tools: *grin* and *ag*


** Understanding better the file system

*** Shells are just operating system pimps
*** Unix is multiuser: file permissions
*** Command: *ln -s*
*** Command: *sudo*
*** Change owner (*chown*), Change group (*chgrp*)
*** Change permissions (*chmod*)
*** In unix everything is a file
*** Devices (/dev)
*** Mounting (*mount*)
*** Mounting points
*** Optional: /etc/fstab
*** Links
*** inodes
*** Moving files (*mv*)
*** Symbolic links (*ln -s*)
