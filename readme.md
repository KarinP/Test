### Learning Linux and Bash

- We have ordered to the library both a hardcopy (always around the office) and the [electronic version](https://filex.imp.ac.at/download.php?c=eaa7546d28add4e74f3ca6a40e173259&f=eea566e50d37056f17e418a0e482634d8993fab7ea2c4285e16f3396a5c325618407ac9fc31d) of "From Bash to Z-Shell". In my opinion, a great book for novices, as well as for seasoned shell users. We can ask the library to get too ebook-reader friendly formats like epub or mobi.

### Learning Git

- A free book is [ProGit](http://git-scm.com/book). It is kind of the "official git book" and even has a [german version](http://git-scm.com/book/de). It is kind of too technical if one is not used to technical reading. The author has at least [one good talk on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR433b0HJY), but the pace can be too fast or too slow depending on how old you are.

- Many people like [Git from the bottom-up](http://newartisans.com/2008/04/git-from-the-bottom-up/).

- Linus [bad-ass talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8) when git was (even) harder to use. Not about using git, but about understanding the motivations behind git design. Some people like me can find it even very entertaining...
