* Unix Shell Exercises

You might want to have run something like "script -t 2>exercises.timings exercises.playscript".

Do not run any script without understanding what it does

** Run the initialization script

#+begin_src bash
cd ~/carpentry/the-unix-shell/exercises
git pull  # Get the latest changes from the online repository
../scripts/initialize_exercises_dirtree.sh santi
#+end_src

As an optional exercise, let's look into the initialisation script:
#+begin_src bash
less ../scripts/initialize_exercises_dirtree.sh
#+end_src
As a general rule, one should always understand what ins running. This script is very simple despite some blah

** Walking around the directory tree

#+begin_src bash
#+end_src

** Bash history tweaking

*** The truth about the bash history mechanism
*** ~/.bash_history
*** Optional: sourcing
*** When is the history read and written?
*** Tweaking bash: ~/.bashrc
*** Discussion: [[http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1288/preserve-bash-history-in-multiple-terminal-windows][Tweaking the history mechanism behavior]]
