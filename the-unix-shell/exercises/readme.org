This directory will be the playground for our unix shell exercises. Initialize it by running:
#+begin_src bash
  ../scripts/initialize_exercises_dirtree.sh <your_nick_name>
#+end_src

For example:
#+begin_src bash
  ../scripts/initialize_exercises_dirtree.sh santi
#+end_src

Everything under this directory is ignored, which means it won't be added to the repository unless explicitly forced.
